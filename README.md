Credit Risk Analysis Report

Explain the purpose of this analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to create and evaluate the accuracy of a data model that predicts the credity worthiness of potential borrowers from peer-to-peer lending services
Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.
Balanced Accuracy Score: 95.20% --> this means that when taking into account the sensitivity (recall and/or true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) of the model, the balanced prediction accuracy was 95.2%
Precision Score: 92% --> This means 92% of predicted positives were correct
Recall Score: 95% --> this means that the model was 95% precise in measuring true positive values our of all positive predictions made.
